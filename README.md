# Public Transportation Usage Analysis – Key Insights & Recommendations
This project analyzes passenger volume across major transit routes, transportation modes, and days of the week to understand travel behavior and support data-driven transportation planning. The goal is to identify dominant transport modes, demand patterns, and opportunities to optimize service delivery.
Public Transportation Usage Analysis

Analyzed passenger volumes across major routes, transport modes, and days of the week to identify demand patterns and optimization opportunities.

Key Findings

Buses dominate high-traffic commuter routes (e.g., North Station ↔ Airport, Central ↔ North Station)

Ferry and train services perform strongly on select corridors

Tram usage is evenly distributed across routes

Passenger demand is consistent throughout the week, with no extreme weekday or weekend spikes

Recommendations

Increase bus capacity and frequency on high-demand routes

Optimize ferry and train scheduling where ridership is strong

Promote multimodal integration through coordinated schedules and ticketing

Apply route-specific strategies rather than one-size-fits-all solutions

Outcome
Delivered actionable insights to support data-driven transit planning, improved service efficiency, and better passenger experience.
